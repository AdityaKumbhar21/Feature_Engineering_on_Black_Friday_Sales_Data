# Feature_Engineering_on_Black_Friday_Sales_Data

### This is a repository created to demonstrate my learnings on Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis.

In this project I performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering on the Black Friday Sales Dataset.

The Dataset was downloaded from kaggle: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/sdolezel/black-friday?select=train.csv)


The overall process was as following:
- **Collection of the Data:**: I collected the data from the kaggle website and then imported it in the jupyter notebook and combined both the train and test data for performing feature engineering.
- **Preprocessed the Data:** Data preprocessing involves identifying categorical and numerical variables and handling of missing values.
- **Data Transformation:** Then I converted various categorical features into numerical like Gender, Age and Stay_in_Current_City.
- **Visualization:** Then I visualized various features to find out relation between them.
- **Feature Scaling:** Then we performed feature sclaing using StandardScaler also performed train, test split on the data.


#### Summary:
I learned various techniques of feature engineering and how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on a specific dataset. Learned about the flow of the process in the feature engineering. 

Also learned how to write observations through visualization and how to find insights and realtion with respect to the feature.
